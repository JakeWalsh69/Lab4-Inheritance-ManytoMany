When an admin logs in ctx.session().get("email") method is called to verify that
the admin's details are correct.

The admin can then click on the addProduct button which will activate the addProduct
method in the products.scala.html class.

Once the admin is in the addProduct class they will be able to add in the relevant fields
such as product name, description, stock etc. Once the admin clicks the addProductSubmit button
their entries will be checked for validation by the addProductForm
which will ensure that the all relevant fields are filled out correctly with the relevant
data types filled out correctly.

The product will then be added to the database successfully once all fields are filled out correctly.
